Let's examine the reward history graphs for each algorithm to see how well they support the conclusions in your study.

### Graph Analysis

1. **Actor-Critic (AC)**: The reward history graph for AC shows a high level of variability in rewards, oscillating significantly between positive and negative values across episodes. This indicates inconsistency in performance, which aligns with the conclusion that AC requires more fine-tuning to reach the efficiency of model-free methods like DDQN and DQN.

2. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: DQN's reward history stabilizes quickly after an initial drop, maintaining a relatively consistent negative reward close to zero. This suggests a robust learning capability, albeit at a lower reward scale, which fits the description of varying degrees of efficiency and adaptability.

3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO's graph also shows high variability, similar to AC, with frequent swings between high and low rewards. This reflects robust learning capabilities but confirms the conclusion about its variable efficiency and adaptability in different scenarios.

4. **Q-Learning (Q-agent)**: The reward history for Q-learning shows a long period of negative rewards that gradually stabilize over a much longer time frame (over 2000 episodes), supporting the conclusion that Q-agent struggles with the time it takes to learn the optimal policy in complex environments.

5. **Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)**: The reward history for DDQN stabilizes quickly and remains relatively consistent throughout the episodes, staying closer to zero compared to DQN, which might imply a better balance between exploration and exploitation as mentioned in your conclusion.

### Conclusion Supportiveness

Based on the reward history graphs:
- **DDQN** shows evidence of enhanced stability and efficiency in learning, which supports your decision to primarily utilize it in the study.
- **DQN** shows robust learning capabilities, consistent with your conclusion.
- **PPO and AC** both exhibit high variability, indicating that while they have robust learning capabilities, their efficiency and adaptability are less consistent.
- **Q-agent**’s long stabilization period matches the conclusion about its slower learning process in complex environments.

Overall, the reward history graphs corroborate the conclusions drawn in your study regarding the performance and characteristics of each algorithm. This suggests that the conclusions are well-supported by the observed data.

### Revised Conclusion with Integrated Maze Solution Analysis

The comprehensive evaluation of Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Deep Q-Network (DQN), Q-agent, Actor-Critic (AC), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has provided a detailed insight into their respective strengths and weaknesses in navigating a complex maze environment. This analysis has considered their efficiency in learning, adaptability, error reduction, and specific performance in actual maze navigation.

**DDQN** not only demonstrates superior stability and efficiency in the reward and error metrics but also excels in practical navigation tasks. Both DDQN and Q-agent solved the maze in the minimal number of steps (25 steps), showcasing their efficiency in finding optimal paths. This underscores DDQN's capability in effectively balancing exploration with exploitation, making it an excellent choice for tasks requiring high levels of both accuracy and efficiency.

**DQN**, while robust in learning stability as indicated by its reward and error trends, required more steps (33 steps) to solve the maze compared to DDQN and Q-agent. This suggests a slight compromise in pathfinding efficiency, though it remains a strong performer overall.

**Q-agent** displayed an unexpectedly efficient pathfinding ability, matching DDQN for the fewest steps to solve the maze. This highlights its potential in scenarios where a straightforward, less computationally intensive approach is sufficient, despite its longer initial learning curve indicated by its reward and error patterns.

**AC** and **PPO** were excluded from the maze solution visualization due to their relatively higher step counts, indicating less efficiency in direct maze-solving tasks. Their exclusion underscores a significant limitation in environments that prioritize direct path efficiency and quick problem-solving capabilities.

In conclusion, **DDQN** stands out as the most balanced and effective algorithm for complex navigation challenges, validated by its performance across all measured criteria. **DQN** and **Q-agent** also show valuable qualities, with DQN offering stability and Q-agent providing a simpler yet effective solution in certain contexts. **AC** and **PPO**, while powerful in learning capabilities, may require further refinement to optimize their pathfinding efficiencies in similar tasks.

# Background Information

## Background on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)

The Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is an enhancement of the Deep Q-Network (DQN), a pivotal algorithm in the field of deep reinforcement learning that integrates deep neural networks with Q-learning. DQN itself was a significant advancement as it demonstrated the capability to approximate the Q-value function, which represents the expected reward for taking an action in a given state, using high-capacity neural networks.

### Evolution from DQN to DDQN

**DQN Challenges**: While DQN substantially improved the stability and performance of Q-learning, it was susceptible to significant overestimations of Q-values due to the noise inherent in the approximation of complex functions by deep neural networks. This overestimation could lead to suboptimal policies and slower convergence during training.

**DDQN Solution**: Introduced by Hado van Hasselt et al., DDQN addresses the overestimation problem of DQN by decoupling the action selection from the target Q-value generation—a technique termed "double learning." In traditional DQN, a single neural network is used both to select the best action and to evaluate its value. DDQN modifies this by employing two networks:
- The **current network** determines the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.
- A separate **target network**, which is a delayed copy of the current network, is used to estimate the Q-value of taking that action at the next state [1].

### The Decoupling Effect

This separation ensures that the selection of the best action is less likely to overestimate Q-values, as the estimation is made using a different set of weights, thus reducing bias in the learning process. The target network's parameters are updated less frequently (often after a set number of steps), which further enhances the algorithm's stability.

### Impact and Applications

DDQN has been shown to achieve better performance and faster convergence in complex environments compared to DQN. It is particularly effective in scenarios where precise action evaluation is crucial, such as in video games and robotic navigation tasks. The improved reliability and accuracy of DDQN make it a valuable model for studying reinforcement learning in controlled environments where stability and efficiency are critical.

## Background on Deep Q-Network (DQN)

The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm represents a significant breakthrough in reinforcement learning by combining traditional Q-learning with deep neural networks. This approach was popularized by researchers at DeepMind with their notable success in training agents that could perform at human levels across various Atari games [2].

**Core Mechanism**: DQN uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function, which is the expected reward obtainable after taking an action in a given state and following a certain policy thereafter. The neural network inputs the state of the environment and outputs Q-values for each possible action, guiding the agent's decisions.

**Innovations Introduced**:
- **Experience Replay**: DQN utilizes a technique called experience replay, where experiences collected during training are stored in a replay buffer. This allows the network to learn from past experiences, reducing the correlations between sequential observations and smoothing over changes in the data distribution.
- **Fixed Q-Targets**: To further stabilize training, DQN employs a separate target network, whose weights are fixed for a number of steps and only periodically updated with the weights from the training network [2].

### Impact and Applications
DQN's ability to handle high-dimensional sensory inputs directly with minimal domain knowledge makes it highly versatile and effective in complex environments such as video games, where it can learn directly from pixels.

## Background on Q-agent (Q-learning)

Q-agent, based on the Q-learning algorithm, is one of the most fundamental types of reinforcement learning methods. It is a model-free algorithm that learns to estimate the values of actions at each state without requiring a model of the environment [3].

**Simplicity and Versatility**: Q-learning works by updating an action-value lookup table called the Q-table, which stores Q-values for each state-action pair. These values are updated using the Bellman equation during each step of training based on the reward received and the maximum predicted reward for the next state.

**Challenges**: While simple and effective for smaller state spaces, Q-learning's reliance on a Q-table becomes impractical in environments with large or continuous state spaces, where the table size would become infeasibly large.

### Impact and Applications
Q-learning has been foundational in teaching agents in environments with discrete, limited state spaces, such as simple mazes or decision-making scenarios with clear, defined states and actions.

## Background on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning that simplifies and improves upon the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) approach. PPO has become popular due to its effectiveness and ease of use [4].

**Optimization Technique**: PPO seeks to take the largest possible improvement step on a policy while avoiding

 too large updates that might lead to performance collapse. It achieves this through an objective function that includes a clipped term, penalizing changes to the policy that move it too far from the previous policy.

**Advantages**: PPO is robust to a variety of hyperparameters and can be used in both continuous and discrete action spaces. It has shown great success in environments ranging from simulated robotics to complex game environments.

### Impact and Applications
PPO is favored in many modern RL applications due to its balance between efficiency, ease of implementation, and strong empirical performance.

## Background on Actor-Critic (AC)

Actor-Critic methods form a broad class of algorithms in reinforcement learning that combine both policy-based (actor) and value-based (critic) approaches [5].

**Dual Components**:
- **Actor**: Responsible for selecting actions based on a policy.
- **Critic**: Estimates the value function (or Q-value), which is used to evaluate how good the action taken by the actor is.

**Advantages**: By separating the action selection and evaluation, actor-critic methods can be more efficient than conventional policy-gradient methods. They reduce the variance of the updates and typically converge faster.

### Impact and Applications
Actor-Critic algorithms are versatile and can be applied to both discrete and continuous action spaces. They have been effectively used in applications that require balancing exploration of the environment with the exploitation of known rewards, such as in robotics and complex game environments.

## Model Architecture and Training Insights

To understand how our Double DQN model learns and makes decisions, let's dive into its architecture. The model consists of four dense layers, which output three actions tailored to the RC car's movement, enabling it to navigate the maze with ease.

Research has shown that, all things being equal, simpler models are often preferred in reinforcement learning [1]. This is because they can lead to better performance, faster learning, and improved generalization. However, finding the right balance of model complexity is crucial [1][3]. Simplicity is not just about the number of layers or parameters, but also about capturing temporal regularities, such as repetitions, in sequential strategies [1][2].

With these insights in mind, we designed the Double DQN model to strike a balance between simplicity and effectiveness, ensuring optimal performance in maze navigation tasks.

### Vragen voor Externe Feedback

#### RC-Auto Oplossingen

- Welke RC-auto oplossing zou volgens u beter passen bij de doelstellingen en methodologie van mijn onderzoeksproject? Heeft u specifieke modellen of merken die u aanbeveelt en waarom?
  - 2WD zoals nu of 4WD en dan aangepaste virtuele omgeving (maakt de draaicirkel anders)?
  - Welke technische kenmerken van een RC-auto zijn cruciaal voor het succes van sim-to-real transfer? Denk aan sensoren, wendbaarheid, motorprestaties, etc.
  - Was mijn RC-auto limiterend in dit project?

**Answer:** Ja en nee, 4WD zou voor nog meer problemen kunnen zorgen, zeker met de over time slippage. Een camera als enige besturing zou ook niet per se beter zijn, aangezien je dan nog altijd vast zit aan het feit dat je de exacte positie van de auto in het doolhof niet weet.

#### Virtuele Omgevingen

- Welke virtuele omgeving zou mij meer vrijheid geven in de manier waarop de auto beweegt in de simulatie? Zijn er specifieke platforms of software die u zou aanraden voor meer realistische simulaties?
  - Of zou ik mijn actiemogelijkheden moeten aanpassen? Bijvoorbeeld controle geven over de motoren? De trainingstijd kan wel langer zijn, maar hierdoor zou de agent zelf kunnen bijsturen.
- Ik weet natuurlijk dat mijn uitwerking nu relatief simpel is, wat ook beperkingen oplegt. Denk je dat als ik mij eerst zou focussen op de autobevinging beter zou zijn geweest?
  - Nu heb ik veel tijd gestoken in de webapplicatie om het te besturen, en kwam ik eigenlijk pas laat erachter dat ik moeite had met de movement replication.

**Answer:** Enkel links, rechts en vooruit zou misschien genoeg zijn als de omgeving meer uitgebreid zou zijn, in plaats van een 2D-array waar de bewegingsmogelijkheden limiterend zijn. In de echte wereld zal de auto zich niet kunnen corrigeren aangezien hij de virtuele twin (of agent) nog altijd perfect op pad is en niet kan afwijken. Aangezien dit niet bestaat in de omgeving, zou controle geven over de motoren zelf niet genoeg zijn. De trainingstijd zou veel langer zijn en de agent zou ook de motor kunnen kapot maken —> goed idee maar zullen veel valkuilen zijn. Het opbouwen van de simulatie, dan de auto testen en vervolgens de simulatie afstemmen zou beter zijn geweest en mij hebben toegelaten om niet pas op het laatste moment te ontdekken dat de virtuele omgeving die ik in het begin had gemaakt toch niet uitgebreid genoeg bleek te zijn (te limiterend).

#### Virtual Twin versus Camera

- Vond u dat een virtual twin een meerwaarde had in deze situatie in vergelijking met het gebruik van een camera? Zo ja, op welke manieren verbeterde de virtual twin de prestaties en nauwkeurigheid van het model?
- Zijn er situaties waarin een camera beter zou presteren dan een virtual twin? Kunt u specifieke voorbeelden of scenario’s noemen waarin dit het geval is?

**Answer:** De virtual twin had hier weinig nut aangezien de simulatie toch niet kon afwijken en je dus eigenlijk niet kon zien waar de robot nu in het echt zit. Een top-down view camera zou nuttiger zijn geweest, al dan niet als input voor de agent.

#### Verdere Uitwerking

- Op welke manieren kan ik dit project verder uitwerken? Heeft u suggesties voor uitbreidingen, zoals het gebruik van geavanceerdere sensoren, meer complexe omgevingen, of integratie van machine learning technieken?
- Hoe ziet u de praktische toepassingen van de resultaten van mijn onderzoek? Zijn er specifieke industrieën of toepassingen waar u denkt dat mijn onderzoek een significante impact zou kunnen hebben?
- Ziet u mogelijkheden voor samenwerking of verdere ontwikkeling van dit project met andere bedrijven of onderzoeksinstituten? Zo ja, welke en op welke manier?
- Ziet u een maatschappelijke, economische of socio-economische meerwaarde in de resultaten van dit project? Kunt u specifieke voorbeelden geven van hoe deze technologieën de samenleving kunnen beïnvloeden?

**Answer:** De mogelijkheden zijn enorm, maar wel buiten het doolhof en RC-auto verhaal. Sim2real zou in veel toepassingen ideaal zijn, bijvoorbeeld customer service, wasmachines, en het vinden van optimale routes in navigatie (vooral in navigatie veel toepassingen), mits dat de omgeving meer uitgebreid is.

#### Algemene Vragen

- Wat zijn volgens u de sterke en zwakke punten van de resultaten uit mijn onderzoeksproject?
- Welke alternatieven of suggesties heeft u voor het project in termen van gebruikte RC-auto's, virtuele omgevingen of andere benaderingen?

**Answer:** Het sterkste punt ben ik zelf, aangezien het niet gebruikelijk is dat er zoveel op zo korte tijd wordt gedaan (simulatie, virtual twin, RC-auto bouwen en laten rijden, agent design, environment, testing in binnen- en buitenomgevingen). Het zwakste punt is geen manier om de RC-auto positie te bepalen.

### Reflection

Reflecting on this research project, I realize how much I've learned and how these insights have shaped my approach and perspective.

Specific suggestions, like increasing the distance to the walls to reduce navigation errors and integrating a camera system for real-time visual feedback, were implemented to enhance accuracy and reliability. This feedback loop was instrumental in refining my approach and improving the overall quality of the project. Wouter suggested that a camera might not solve all positioning issues but could complement other sensory data to improve overall system accuracy. He also pointed out that a virtual twin might have limited usefulness in some scenarios compared to a top-down view camera.

#### Methodological Insights

Creating the custom maze navigation environment (RCMazeEnv) and using the DDQN architecture provided significant insights into the complexities of sim-to-real transfer. The iterative process of testing, calibration, and adjustment refined the system and improved its performance in navigating the physical maze. Designing an effective reward function was key to guiding the agent’s learning process, balancing immediate rewards and penalties for inefficient actions to optimize performance. This methodological rigor will serve as a foundation for future projects, ensuring a structured and systematic approach to research and development. Feedback from recent interviews, including Wouter's, suggested that while it was crucial to have a structured environment, there were limits to how much could be controlled virtually.

#### Societal Implications of Autonomous Systems

Furthermore, I will strive to ensure that my work contributes to the greater good, addressing societal challenges and promoting sustainability.

### Personal Note

Even though this was an incredible project to work on and I loved every second of it, I can’t help but feel like I limited myself by not actively researching before starting this project. I went into this (and many other projects before this) headfirst, starting to make a maze in Pygame even before the three-week period began. However, by doing this, I limited myself by not exploring other methods of completing this maze, like giving the agents more controls than just moving forward, left, and right. For example, as Wouter suggested during one of our evaluations, the use of a top-down view camera to see where the car is in the maze. This would solve the problem of the car not knowing where it is in the maze, and potentially serve as another input for the agent to use, thus giving it more information to work with than just the distance sensors.

Feedback from another reddit user suggested that direct control over the motors could improve the transfer of the simulation and deal with the problem of fixed movements like it has now, although it might increase the training time and risk of damaging the motors. This insight highlights the importance of balancing control flexibility with practical constraints.

I doubt I would have been able to get as far as fast as I did if I had taken an alternative route, but I do think it would have been a lot more interesting and maybe even more rewarding as I don’t think this project is completely finished yet, and I look forward to continuing this journey.
