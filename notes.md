Here are the evaluation criteria for all the sections based guidlines:

### Inleiding (Introduction)
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: The introduction does not give a clear picture of what the bachelor thesis is about. The research question is either missing or not clear.
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: The research question is formulated without sufficient context. It does not invite the reader to read further.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: The introduction describes the research question and sets the context. The structure of the thesis is briefly mentioned.
- **Goed (Good)**: The research question is presented from a concrete problem statement. The research is discussed briefly, and the structure of the thesis is highlighted.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: The reader's interest is immediately aroused by starting from a meaningful background. The problem is derived logically, and the research question is clearly presented. The structure of the thesis is thoroughly explained.

### Research
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: Essential theoretical components are not discussed. No or incorrect source citation.
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: The theoretical foundation of the thesis is weak. Technologies are not sufficiently explained. The quality of sources is inadequate.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: A limited number of sources are consulted. All theoretical sub-questions are answered. The reader has sufficient background information.
- **Goed (Good)**: Various sources (books, websites, podcasts, online courses, etc.) are consulted. The research provides a good picture of the current technology. Sources are verified.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: Research is of high quality; different sources are compared and evaluated on quality.

### Technisch Onderzoek (Technical Research)
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: The reader finds it difficult or impossible to understand what the student has technically realized.
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: The result is described, but many aspects remain unclear.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: Clear description of the delivered research results with minimal motivation.
- **Goed (Good)**: This section not only discusses the structure of the result but also the different choices with motivation. Technologies and methodologies are clearly explained.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: This section allows the reader to reconstruct the entire research process smoothly. A critical analysis of interim results shows continuous adjustments to the research process.

### Reflectie (Reflection)
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: The reflection on the result is completely missing or is substandard (no sound motivation, ...).
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: The student has only done self-reflection. Motivation is present.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: The research results are critically evaluated; self-reflection is complemented by limited external input.
- **Goed (Good)**: Reflection is based on contacts with various externals, making it very valuable and useful for both the student and the reader.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: Reflection is substantiated through contacts with externals from different backgrounds/disciplines. This highlights the limitations of the work field. Both technical and organizational contexts are considered.

### Advies (Advice)
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: The advice is missing or substandard in quality: own interpretations, repetition of information from previous sections.
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: Advice is present but insufficiently substantiated. The link with conducted research and/or reflection with externals is missing, making the advice less useful.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: The advice clearly builds on own research results and is sufficiently substantiated.
- **Goed (Good)**: Besides substantiated advice, other relevant alternatives/suggestions are formulated.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: Advice includes a concrete step-by-step plan based on own research experiences and contacts with externals.

### Conclusie (Conclusion)
- **Onvoldoende (Insufficient)**: The conclusion does not answer the research question, is not meaningful, or contains new (unsubstantiated) information.
- **Beperkt (Limited)**: The conclusion only answers the research question without involving the most important points from reflection and advice.
- **Voldoende (Sufficient)**: The research question is correctly answered, clearly referring to information from reflection and/or advice sections.
- **Goed (Good)**: The most important elements from previous sections are succinctly summarized, answering the research question conclusively.
- **Excellent (Excellent)**: Besides answering the research question thoroughly, the reader is prompted to further research on the topic. Suggestions are provided.
