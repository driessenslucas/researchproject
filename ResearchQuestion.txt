## Abstract

This research project explores the feasibility of transferring a trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent from a simulated environment to navigating a real-world maze using a remote-controlled (RC) car. The study investigates the applicability of sim2real techniques, evaluates the performance of the RL agent in both virtual and physical realms, and provides insights into the challenges and potential of real-time learning in autonomous navigation.
