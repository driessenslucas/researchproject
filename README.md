# Exploring the Feasibility of Sim2Real Transfer in Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

This project at Howest University investigates the transfer of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent from a simulated environment to the real world, with a focus on maze navigation using a remote-controlled car. It aims to bridge theoretical RL models and real-world applications in AI and robotics.

## Project Summary

The research evaluates the feasibility of sim2real transfer in RL through a series of sub-questions addressing the choice of virtual environments, RL techniques, and the practical aspects of transitioning from simulation to reality.

## Methodology

### Virtual Environment: RCMazeEnv

- Customized environment using OpenAI Gym for simulating a robotic car in a maze.

### Reinforcement Learning: Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)

- DDQN selected for its effectiveness in reducing Q-value overestimation, crucial for navigating complex environments.

### Experimental Approach

- Detailed configuration of the virtual environment, agent setup, and real-world implementation, including hardware components and sensor integration.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Insight into the practical challenges faced, such as sim2real transfer discrepancies, sensor data alignment, and movement replication, along with the solutions implemented.

## Real-World Application and Limitations

- Exploration of the application of sensor-based navigation in autonomous vehicles and the limitations encountered in real-world scenarios.

## Supplementary Materials

- Video demonstrations showcasing various tests and experiments.

## Credits

- Special thanks to supervisor Gevaert Wouter for his invaluable guidance and support.
