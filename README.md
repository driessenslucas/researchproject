# Exploring the Feasibility of Sim2Real Transfer in Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the research and implementation files for the bachelor thesis by Lucas Driessens, presented at Howest, focused on sim-to-real transfer in reinforcement learning, particularly navigating a maze using a remote-controlled (RC) car.

## Project Overview

This thesis investigates the transition of reinforcement learning algorithms from simulated environments to real-world applications. The core of this research revolves around the practical deployment of a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) for controlling an RC car in a physical maze setting, highlighting both the potential and challenges of such technological transfers.

### Objectives

- Validate the practical application of simulated RL algorithms in real-world scenarios.
- Assess the efficacy of DDQN in real-world maze navigation.
- Explore the interplay between theoretical concepts and their real-world implementations.

## Key Insights

- **Sim-to-Real Transition Challenges:** Detailed exploration of adjustments needed to translate simulation training into real-world effectiveness.
- **Algorithmic Efficacy:** Analysis on the performance of DDQN in navigating complex real-world environments.
- **Practical Implementation Considerations:** Discussion on overcoming real-world implementation challenges, including sensor integration and environmental variability.

## Contributions

This project welcomes academic collaborations and further research enhancements. Contributions that improve the algorithms, extend the simulations, or refine the real-world testing components are highly encouraged.
