# Research Project

## Description

### Main Research Question

> In which ways can reinforcement learning be applied to control an RF-car? (through a maze)

### Sub Research Questions

1. Which virtual environments exist to train a virtual RF-car?

2. Which reinforcement learning techniques can I best use in this application?

3. Can the simulation be transferred to the real world?

4. Does the simulation have any useful contributions? In terms of training time or performance?

5. How can I transfer my trained model to my physical RC car? (sim2real)
